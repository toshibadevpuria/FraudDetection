# FraudDetection
To build a robust machine learning system that detects fraudulent transactions in real-time to reduce financial losses and improve customer trust.
Tech Stack:
Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost (model)

Kafka / Flask API (real-time data stream simulation)

Spark Structured Streaming / Kafka consumer

PostgreSQL / MongoDB (storage)

Docker, Airflow, CI/CD (optional for production simulation)

Grafana / Kibana (for monitoring)

. Problem Statement:
With increasing digital transactions, frauds (like card theft, account takeover, or fake identities) are on the rise. The challenge is to build a system that:

Detects fraudulent transactions instantly

Minimizes false positives, ensuring a seamless experience for genuine users

Adapts over time to new fraud patterns
